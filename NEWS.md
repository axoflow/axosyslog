4.12.0
======

AxoSyslog is binary-compatible with syslog-ng [1] and serves as a drop-in replacement.

We provide [cloud-ready container images](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/#container-images) and Helm charts.

Packages are available in our [APT](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/#deb-packages) and [RPM](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/#rpm-packages) repositories (Ubuntu, Debian, AlmaLinux, Fedora).

Check out the [AxoSyslog documentation](https://axoflow.com/docs/axosyslog-core/) for all the details.

## Features

  * `clickhouse()` destination: Added `server-side-schema()` option.

    Sending data to ClickHouse in Protobuf format has some limitations.
    The Protobuf formatted data does not carry type information,
    so there are two ways of determining the type mapping in ClickHouse:

    1. Using autogenerated schema: https://clickhouse.com/docs/interfaces/formats/Protobuf#using-autogenerated-protobuf-schema

       This method looks at the table that the data is getting inserted
       into and generates the default protobuf mapping for it.

       The problem with this solution is that some more complex column
       types can receive data from different input types, for example
       DateTime64 can recieve from uint64, string, float, but with the
       autogenerated schema you can utilize only one of them.

    2. Using format schema: https://clickhouse.com/docs/interfaces/formats#formatschema

       This method solves the issue of the autogenerated schema, but
       needs a more complex setup. First you need to place a .proto
       file along your server in a specific directory, then you can
       reference that schema during insert, which is done by the
       `server-side-schema()` option.

    Example: `server-side-schema("my_proto_file_on_server:my_message_schema_name")`
    ([#666](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/666))


## Bugfixes

  * Fixed some time parsing and time formatting issues.
    ([#626](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/626))

  * `network()`, `syslog()` destinations: handle async TLS messages (KeyUpdate, etc.)
    ([#609](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/609))

  * `rate-limit()`: fix precision issue that could occur at a very low message rate
    ([#599](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/599))

  * `metrics`: fix `syslogng_last_config_file_modification_timestamp_seconds`
    ([#612](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/612))

  * `pubsub-grpc()` destination: Fixed message size counting.
    ([#652](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/652))

  * `collectd()`: fix not reading server responses
    ([#609](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/609))

  * `regexp-parser()`: fix double-free with invalid configuration
    ([#670](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/670))

## FilterX features

  * `-` `*` `/` `%`: Added new filterx arithmetic operators.

    Example usage:
    ```
    if (3 - 3 == 0)
    if (3.0 * 3 == 9.0)
    if (3.0 / 3.0 == 1.0)
    if (4 % 3 == 1)
    ```

    Note: A general `+` operator already exists. `%` only accepts integer values.
    ([#625](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/625))

  * `in`: Added new filterx operator for membership check.

    Example usage:
    ```
    s_arr = ['foo', 'bar', 'asd'];
    if ("foo" in s_arr)
    ```
    or
    ```
    s_arr = ['foo', 'bar', 'asd'];
    if ("bar" not in s_arr)
    ```
    ([#617](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/617))

  * Failure information tracking

    The following functions have been added to allow tracking failures in FilterX code:

    - `failure_info_enable()`, optional parameter: `collect_falsy=true/false`, defaults to `false`:
      Enable failure information collection from this point downwards through all branches of the pipeline.

    - `failure_info_clear()`:
      Clear accumulated failure information

    - `failure_info_meta({})`:
      Attach metadata to the given section of FilterX code. The metadata remains in effect until the next call
      or until the end of the enclosing FilterX block, whichever comes first.

    - `failure_info()`:
      Return failure information as a FilterX dictionary. This should ideally be called as late as possible, for example, in the last log path of your configuration or within a fallback path.

    Example output:

    ```
    [
      {
        "meta": {
          "step": "Setting common fields"
        },
        "location": "/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf:33:7",
        "line": "nonexisting.key = 13;",
        "error": "No such variable: nonexisting"
      }
    ]
    ```
    ([#629](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/629))

  * `strcasecmp()`: case insensitive string comparison
    ([#580](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/580))

  * `update_metric()`: Labels containing `null` and `""` (empty string) values are now skipped.
    ([#671](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/671))


## FilterX bugfixes

  * `metrics_labels`: Fixed a crash that occurred when trying to get a label from an empty object.
    ([#601](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/601))

  * `cache_json_file()`: fix updating json content on file changes
    ([#612](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/612))


## Other changes

  * `loggen`: statistics output has slightly changed

    The new `--perf` option can be used to measure the log throughput of AxoSyslog.
    ([#598](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/598))

  * `stats()`: `freq()` now defaults to 0

    Internal statistic messages were produced every 10 minutes by default.
    Metrics are available through `syslog-ng-ctl`, we believe modern monitoring and
    observability render this periodic message obsolete.
    ([#600](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/600))
