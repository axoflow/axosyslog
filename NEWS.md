## Bugfixes

  * `strftime()` FilterX function: Fixed %Z formatting for some rare cases

    America/Caracas (-04:30) time offset will now be correctly formatted.
    ([#811](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/811))

  * `disk-buffer()`: fix getting stuck under rare circumstances
    ([#813](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/813))

  * `disk-buffer()`: do not allow flow-control misconfiguration
    The `flow-control-window_size()` (formerly `mem-buf-length()`) option is now deprecated and no longer has any
    effect.
