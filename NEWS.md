AxoSyslog is binary-compatible with syslog-ng [1] and serves as a drop-in replacement.

We provide [cloud-ready container images](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/#container-images) and Helm charts.

Packages are available in our [APT](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/#deb-packages) and [RPM](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/#rpm-packages) repositories (Ubuntu, Debian, AlmaLinux, Fedora).

## Features

  * `format_syslog_5424()`: Added new FilterX function for syslog formatting

    Usage:
    ```
    format_syslog_5424(
      message,
      add_octet_count=false,
      pri=expr,
      timestamp=expr,
      host=expr,
      program=expr,
      pid=expr,
      msgid=expr
    )
    ```

    `message` is the only mandatory argument.

    Fallback values will be used instead of the named arguments
    if they are not set, or their evaluation fails.
    ([#875](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/875))

  * `http()` and other threaded destinations: add `worker-partition-autoscaling(yes)`

    When `worker-partition-key()` is used to categorize messages into different batches,
    the messages are - by default - hashed into workers, which prevents them from being distributed across workers
    efficiently, based on load.

    The new `worker-partition-autoscaling(yes)` option uses a 1-minute statistic to help distribute
    high-traffic partitions among multiple workers, allowing each worker to maximize its batch size.

    When using this autoscaling option, it is recommended to oversize the number of workers: set it higher than the
    expected number of partitions.
    ([#855](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/855))

  * New metrics: `syslogng_output_workers` and `syslogng_output_active_worker_partitions`

    Using the new `worker-partition-autoscaling(yes)` option allows producing partition metrics, which can be used
    for alerting: if the number of active partitions remains higher than the configured number of workers,
    it may indicate that events are not being batched properly, which can lead to performance degradation.
