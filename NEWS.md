## Features

  * `dict_to_pairs()` FilterX function: Added a new function to convert dicts to list of pairs

    Example usage:
    ```
    dict = {
        "value_1": "foo",
        "value_2": "bar",
        "value_3": ["baz", "bax"],
    };

    list = dict_to_pairs(dict, "key", "value");
    # Becomes:
    # [
    #   {"key":"value_1","value":"foo"},
    #   {"key":"value_2","value":"bar"},
    #   {"key":"value_3","value":["baz","bax"]}
    # ]
    ```
    ([#810](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/810))


## Bugfixes

  * `syslogng_output_unreachable` metric: fix marking destinations unreachable during reload
    ([#818](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/818))

  * `transport(proxied-tcp)`: Fix a HAProxy protocol v2 parsing issue that
    caused a failed assertion.  This essentially triggers a crash with a SIGABRT
    whenever a "LOCAL" command was sent in the HAProxy header without address
    information.
    ([#814](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/814))

  * filterx: fix `parse_csv` function crash if coulumns specified non-existent variable
    ([#819](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/819))

  * `opentelemetry()` source: fix various crashes during startup/reload
    ([#822](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pull/822))
