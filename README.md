This repository contains the AxoSyslog source tree, cloud-ready syslog-ng images, and Helm charts
created and maintained by [Axoflow](https://axoflow.com).

## Container images

You can find the list of tagged versions at [https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pkgs/container/axosyslog](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pkgs/container/axosyslog).

To install the latest stable version, run:

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/axoflow/axosyslog:latest
```

You can also use it as a base image in your Dockerfile:

```shell
FROM ghcr.io/axoflow/axosyslog:latest
```

If you want to test a development version, you can use the nightly builds:

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/axoflow/axosyslog:nightly
```

> Note: These named packages are automatically updated when a new syslog-ng package is released. To install a specific version, run `docker pull ghcr.io/axoflow/axosyslog:<version-number>`, for example:
>
> ```shell
> docker pull ghcr.io/axoflow/axosyslog:4.99.99
> ```

### Difference from upstream images

Our images are different from the [upstream syslog-ng images](https://hub.docker.com/r/balabit/syslog-ng/) in a number of ways:

- They are based on Alpine Linux, instead of Debian testing for reliability and smaller size (thus smaller attack surface).
- They incorporate cloud-native features and settings (such as the Kubernetes source).
- They incorporate container-level optimizations (like the use of an alternative malloc library) for better performance and improved security.
- They support the ARM architecture.

Our images are available for the following architectures:

- amd64
- arm/v7
- arm64

## Helm Charts

AxoSyslog provides [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/) to deploy syslog-ng on Kubernetes.

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.  Please refer to
Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

    helm repo add axosyslog https://axoflow.github.io/axosyslog

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve
the latest versions of the packages.  You can then run `helm search repo
axosyslog` to see the charts.

To install the axosyslog chart:

    helm install my-axosyslog axosyslog/axosyslog

To uninstall the chart:

    helm delete my-axosyslog

## Documentation

You can find [comprehensive documentation for AxoSyslog](https://axoflow.com/docs/axosyslog-core)
on the [Axoflow website](https://axoflow.com/).

The documentation is a combination of the syslog-ng reference guide and the
AxoSyslog reference guide.  The [syslog-ng documentation](https://axoflow.com/docs/axosyslog-core)
was included in there as the upstream documentation fell out of maintenance.
