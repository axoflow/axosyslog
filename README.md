AxoSyslog started as a syslog-ng [[1]](#r1) fork, branched right after
syslog-ng v4.7.1 with the following focus:
  * cloud native (containers, helm charts, kubernetes integration),
  * security data tailored parsing and transformation (filterx, app-parser, app-transform, etc)
  * performance (eBPF, memory allocator, etc),

AxoSyslog (created by the original creators of syslog-ng [[1]](#r1)):
- is a drop in replacement for syslog-ng [[1]](#r1),
- keeps using the same license and development practices.

This repository contains the AxoSyslog source tree, container images, and Helm charts
created and maintained by [Axoflow](https://axoflow.com).

<a id="r1">[1]</a> syslog-ng is a trademark of One Identity.

## Quick-start

To start using AxoSyslog, you can use one of these
deployment mechanisms:
  - pure containers (docker, podman)
  - Helm charts (Kubernetes)
  - packages (deb, rpm, etc)

Once the binaries are deployed, create a configuration file called
`/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf`, which will then be processed by
the `syslog-ng` process.

A simple example is to ingest syslog traffic on tcp/514 and write it to a
file:

```
@version: 4.12
@include "scl.conf"

log {
	source {
		system();
		network();
	};
	destination { file("/var/log/syslog"); };
};
```

You can find more examples in the [Quickstart section of the
documentation](https://axoflow.com/docs/axosyslog-core/quickstart/).

## Container images

You can find the list of tagged versions at [https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pkgs/container/axosyslog](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog/pkgs/container/axosyslog).

To install the latest stable version, run:

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/axoflow/axosyslog:latest
```

You can also use it as a base image in your Dockerfile:

```shell
FROM ghcr.io/axoflow/axosyslog:latest
```

If you want to test a development version, you can use the nightly builds:

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/axoflow/axosyslog:nightly
```

> Note: These named packages are automatically updated when a new AxoSyslog package is released. To install a specific version, run `docker pull ghcr.io/axoflow/axosyslog:<version-number>`, for example:
>
> ```shell
> docker pull ghcr.io/axoflow/axosyslog:4.12.0
> ```

The container images contain a default configuration file which you probably
want to customize. Read more about using these images [directly via
podman/docker](https://axoflow.com/docs/axosyslog-core/install/podman-systemd/)

Our images are available for the following architectures:

- amd64
- arm/v7
- arm64

## Helm Charts

AxoSyslog provides [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/) to deploy on Kubernetes.

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.  Please refer to
Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

    helm repo add axosyslog https://axoflow.github.io/axosyslog

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve
the latest versions of the packages.  You can then run `helm search repo
axosyslog` to see the charts.

To install the axosyslog chart:

    helm install my-axosyslog axosyslog/axosyslog

To uninstall the chart:

    helm delete my-axosyslog

Helm charts would use the latest images by default, but you can customize
that via the values file.
For details, see [Install AxoSyslog with Helm](https://axoflow.com/docs/axosyslog-core/install/helm/).

## DEB packages

You can install AxoSyslog on your Debian-based system from Axoflow's APT repository.
AxoSyslog is a drop in replacement for the syslog-ng Debian package, all the binaries
and configuration files are stored at the same place on your system.

The following x86-64 distros are supported:

| Distro          | sources.list component |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Debian 12       | debian-bookworm        |
| Debian 11       | debian-bullseye        |
| Debian Unstable | debian-sid             |
| Debian Testing  | debian-testing         |
| Ubuntu 24.10    | ubuntu-oracular        |
| Ubuntu 24.04    | ubuntu-noble           |
| Ubuntu 22.04    | ubuntu-jammy           |
| Ubuntu 20.04    | ubuntu-focal           |

To add the APT repo (e.g. Ubuntu 24.04):

```
wget -qO - https://pkg.axoflow.io/axoflow-code-signing-pub.asc | gpg --dearmor > /usr/share/keyrings/axoflow-code-signing-pub.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/axoflow-code-signing-pub.gpg] https://pkg.axoflow.io/apt stable ubuntu-noble" | tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list.d/axoflow.list

apt update
```

Nightly builds are also available:

```
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/axoflow-code-signing-pub.gpg] https://pkg.axoflow.io/apt nightly ubuntu-noble" | tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list.d/axoflow.list
```

To install AxoSyslog:
```
apt install axosyslog
```

## RPM packages

You can install AxoSyslog on your RPM-based system from Axoflow's RPM repository.
AxoSyslog is a drop in replacement for the syslog-ng RPM package, all the binaries
and configuration files are stored at the same place on your system.

The following x86-64 distros are supported:

| Distro          | axosyslog.repo component |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Fedora 39       | fedora                   |
| Fedora 40       | fedora                   |
| Fedora 41       | fedora                   |
| AlmaLinux 8     | almalinux                |
| AlmaLinux 9     | almalinux                |

To add the RPM repo (e.g. Fedora 41):

```
yum install -y epel-release

tee /etc/yum.repos.d/axosyslog.repo <<< '[axosyslog]
name=AxoSyslog
baseurl=https://pkg.axoflow.io/rpm/stable/fedora-$releasever/$basearch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://pkg.axoflow.io/axoflow-code-signing-pub.asc' > /dev/null

yum update -y
```

Nightly builds are also available:

```
tee /etc/yum.repos.d/axosyslog.repo <<< '[axosyslog]
name=AxoSyslog
baseurl=https://pkg.axoflow.io/rpm/nightly/fedora-$releasever/$basearch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://pkg.axoflow.io/axoflow-code-signing-pub.asc' > /dev/null
```

To install AxoSyslog:
```
yum install -y axosyslog
```

### Extra repos

As the example above showed, EPEL is necessary for AxoSyslog to work.
Certain AxoSyslog modules need extra dependencies on some of the supported distros.

#### Fedora

```
dnf install -y dnf-plugins-core
```

#### AlmaLinux 8

```
yum install -u yum-plugin-copr
yum config-manager --set-enabled powertools
```

#### AlmaLinux 9

```
dnf config-manager --set-enabled crb
```

## Documentation

You can find [comprehensive documentation for AxoSyslog](https://axoflow.com/docs/axosyslog-core)
on the [Axoflow website](https://axoflow.com/).

## Difference from syslog-ng

The original founder of syslog-ng forked off AxoSyslog from the original
syslog-ng after the 4.7.1 release. AxoSyslog is a drop in replacement, retaining
the original license, release schedule and processes.
