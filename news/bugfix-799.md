`python()`: `LogTemplate::format()` now returns a `bytes` object

In the Python bindings, `LogMessage` is not UTF-8 or Unicodeâ€“safe by default.
This means developers must explicitly call `decode()` on message fields and handle any decoding errors themselves.

Since `LogTemplate` operates on `LogMessage` fields, this behavior also applies to it.

Breaking change:
When using templates, you now need to decode the result manually. For example:
`format().decode("utf-8", errors="backslashreplace")`
